	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p> Acute cellular rejection(ACR) is the consequence of an immune response of the host against allograft(transplanted organ/tissue from donor). ACR increases the risk of developing chronic rejection and decreases allograft half-life by 34%(Matas AJ et al., 1994). Histological analysis of allograft biopsy is the current golden standard technique to diagnose ACR. However, allograft biopsy can recognize the immune reaction only at its later stages, when allograft injury has already been established. Therefore, identification of noninvasive biomarkers capable of identifying early signs of acute rejection represents an area of intense research.</p>

    <p><b>Gene Type & Source:</b>   RNA(bulk) of endomycardial biopsies</p>
	<p><b>Gene Profiling Platform:</b>  Illumina Human HT-12V4 BeadChips(<a href="https://support.illumina.com/downloads/humanht-12_v4_product_file.html">manifest</a>)</p>
    <p><b>Summary:</b>	During the first year after a cardiac transplant, it is common practice to perform histological examination of endomycardial biopsy monthly to monitor ACR. The study looked at 36 such biopsies from 30 patients. 36 biopsies were divided into 3 groups: rejection(13 biopsies)-ACR;  control(13 biopsies)-no ACR; before rejection(10 biopsies)-no ACR, but there was ACR on the next-month biopsy, e.g. a before-rejection biopsy A from patient T is taken on the second month after T's cardiac transplant, and a histological examination shows no ACR in A, but another biopsy taken from T a month later has ACR. The authors performed differential analysis on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from the biopsies. They indentified some differentially expressed genes and concluded that cardiac molecular signs precede histological ACR alterations(the LDA using differentially expressed genes separate control and before control group well)</p>
