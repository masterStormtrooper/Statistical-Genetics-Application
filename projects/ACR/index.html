	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p> Acute cellular rejection(ACR) is the consequence of an immune response of the host against allograft(transplanted organ/tissue from donor). ACR increases the risk of developing chronic rejection and decreases allograft half-life by 34%(Matas AJ et al., 1994). Histological analysis of allograft biopsy is the current golden standard technique to diagnose ACR. However, allograft biopsy can recognize the immune reaction only at its later stages, when allograft injury has already been established. Therefore, identification of noninvasive biomarkers capable of identifying early signs of acute rejection represents an area of intense research.</p>
