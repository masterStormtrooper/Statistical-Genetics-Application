	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p> Acute cellular rejection(ACR) is the consequence of an immune response of the host against allograft(transplanted organ/tissue from donor). ACR increases the risk of developing chronic rejection and decreases allograft half-life by 34%(Matas AJ et al., 1994). Histological analysis of allograft biopsy is the current golden standard technique to diagnose ACR. However, allograft biopsy can recognize the immune reaction only at its later stages, when allograft injury has already been established. Therefore, identification of noninvasive biomarkers capable of identifying early signs of acute rejection represents an area of intense research.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>	During the first year after a cardiac transplant, it is a common practice to perform monthly histological examination of endomycardial biopsy to monitor ACR. This retrospective study looked at 36 such biopsies from 30 patients. The biopsies were divided into 3 groups: rejection(13 biopsies)-ACR;  control(13 biopsies)-no ACR; before rejection(10 biopsies)-no ACR, but there was ACR on the next-month biopsy, e.g. a before-rejection biopsy A from patient T is taken on the second month after T's cardiac transplant, and a histological examination shows no ACR in A, but another biopsy taken from T a month later has ACR. The authors performed differential analysis on the bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from the biopsies. They indentified some differentially expressed genes and concluded that cardiac molecular signs precede histological ACR alterations(the LDA using differentially expressed genes separate control and before control group well)</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>	The study looked at 14 patients that had cardiac transplants and developed ACR post surgury.Routine endomyocardial biopsies were performed according to the following schedule: weekly during the first six weeks, every other week from week 6 to month 3 and monthly from month 3 to month 6. For each of the patients, 3 biopsies were included in the study: the biopsie where ACR was first identified(denote as A); the closest(in terms of time)biopsy taken before A that showed no ACR;  the closest biopsy taken after A that showed no ACR. The authors found a distinct up-regulation of CXCL9 during ACR. They also did serum analysis(proteins) and the distinct up-regulation of CXCL9 was not reflected in the serum levels of the encoded protein.</p>
